## Socket

The Internet was designed to be entirely **packet switch**ed.

What is a packet?

It is protocol data unit (PDU) of network layer.

Each and every packet has to have all the necessary information it needs to get to the destination. Like a **letter**, a packet must include **source** and **destination** addresses.

Every computer connected to the Internet has an **Internet Protocol (IP) address** Without the uniqueness, there is no way to know the proper destination for packets. **TCP/IP** takes the addressing one step further with the concept of **ports**.

Every **layer** in the protocol adds its own **signature** and other data (**wrapper**) to the transmission packet. When transmitted, the wrapper helps the receiver forward the message to the appropriate layer to await reading.

The packet switches from one computer to the next along the connections (or **link**s). If the network **loses** a link while passing a message, the packet finds another **route **(switching), or the router bounces an **error** back to the originator if it fails to reach the host.

This ensures a form of **data** **reliability**.

Socket is an abstraction built on top of packet switching.

A network socket is a software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as an **endpoint** for sending and receiving data across the network. (WebSockets are built on top of network sockets).

Each **client** interfaces with the **operating system** by making several **calls** in succession in order to to **connect to a server**.

The socket() system call does nothing more than **create** the **queues** for sending and receiving data.

Only when your program executes a bind() system call does the operating system **connect** the queue to the network.

connect() connects to peer/server. Reach out and establish a **bidirectional** channel between your program and another network program.

read() / write() send/receive messages.

close() closes the connection.

Socket programming differs from typical application or tool programming, because you work with concurrently running programs and systems. This means that you need to consider **synchronization**, **timing**, and **resource management**.


## Socket API

Most programming languages provide higher-level socket API.

For example,


* [https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) in Python.
* [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html)

  [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/net/ServerSocket.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/net/ServerSocket.html)


    in Java.



### Py4J

Py4J relies on socket API in both Python and Java.

Py4J enables Python programs running in a Python interpreter to dynamically access Java objects in a Java Virtual Machine. Py4J also enables Java programs to call back Python objects.


```
class GatewayConnection(object):
    """Default gateway connection (socket based) responsible for communicating
       with the Java Virtual Machine."""

    def start(self):
        """Starts the connection by connecting to the `address` and the `port`
        """
        try:
            self.socket.connect((self.address, self.port))
	...
```

```
	/**
	 * <p>
	 * Starts the ServerSocket.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @throws Py4JNetworkException
	 *         If the port is busy.
	 */
	protected void startSocket() throws Py4JNetworkException {
		try {
			sSocket = sSocketFactory.createServerSocket();
			sSocket.setSoTimeout(connectTimeout);
			sSocket.setReuseAddress(true);
			sSocket.bind(new InetSocketAddress(address, port), -1);
		} catch (IOException e) {
			throw new Py4JNetworkException(e);
		}
	}
```

# Web API Design

## What are web APIs
Interfaces are contracts that define how two systems should interact with one another.

APIs are special types of interfaces that define how two computer systems interact with one another, coming in many forms, such as downloadable libraries and web APIs.

An API defines the way in which computer systems interact.

Web APIs are special because they expose functionality over a network, hiding the specific implementation or computational requirements needed for that functionality.

Resource-oriented APIs are a way of designing APIs to reduce complexity by relying on a standard set of actions, called methods, across a limited set of things, called resources.

## What makes an API “good”
What is the purpose of building an API in the first place? 

- We have some functionality that some users want.
- Those users want to use this functionality programmatically.

Given these two criteria, where does this lead us when thinking about the desirable qualities of an API?

- Operational: it must do the thing users actually want
- Expressive: allows users to express the thing they want to do clearly and simply
- Simple: expose the functionality that users want in the most straightforward way possible, making the API as simple as possible
- Predictable: rely on repeated patterns applied to both the API surface definition and the behavior. (e.g. "text" in TranslateText(text) and DetectLanguage(text))

## Design

### Implementation Guidelines
- Craft URIs
- Map domain actions to HTTP methods (CRUD)
- Use the proper HTTP Status Codes
- Document serialized objects as HTTP bodies
- Use HTTP headers responsibly
- Describe edge cases (async, errors, authN/Z)

### Design e.g. Maze game API
1. List the Semantic Descriptors

2. Draw a State Diagram

3. Reconcile Names

4. Choose a Media Type

5. Write a Profile

   Use Media Type to represetn Semantic Descriptors.

6. Implementation

   Running code.
7. Publication

### Final Advice
- Resources are implementation details.
- Don't fall into collection trap.
- Don't start with the representation format.
- URL design doesn't matter (as long as it's consistent).
- Standard names are probably better than yours.

### Conclusion
- Don't confuse implementation w/ design.
- Design is the hard part (high value).
- Implementation is the easy part (high speed).
- Avoid common design mistakes.

# Data Ingestion

_Just like we eat food to get energy, computer systems "eat" or "ingest" data to get information._ üçΩÔ∏èüíª

A data ingestion system is a framework or set of processes that facilitates the transfer of data from diverse 
sources to a storage medium where it can be accessed, used, and analyzed.

## Data Collection

Different data come from different places, like databases, websites, or even smart devices. We'd use things called 
**protocol handlers** to make sure our system can "talk" to these sources without any mix-ups.

For data that's scheduled, like grabbing daily weather reports, we'd set up a **scheduler** to do this job. And for 
real-time stuff, like live tweets or instant updates, tools like **stream processors** come into play.

Now, imagine everyone trying to enter a room at once; it'd be chaos. The same can happen with data. So, we'd use 
**backpressure** strategies to manage when too much data tries to come in at the same time.

We'd also make sure all our data travels and sits safely. That means it's **encrypted** or coded to keep it private and 
secure, especially when it's on the move.

And finally, we'd keep a close eye on how things are going. Using **monitoring** tools, we can see if everything's 
working right or if there are any hiccups.

**Protocol Handlers**

In computing, **protocols** define the rules for how data is transmitted and received over a network. 
**Protocol handlers** interpret and implement these rules for specific types of communication protocols, such as HTTP 
for web traffic or FTP for file transfers. They ensure that data is correctly formatted, transmitted, and understood 
between different systems or software.

**Schedulers**

- Time-Based Scheduling: Tasks are run at specific times or intervals.

- Event-Driven Scheduling: Tasks initiated in response to specific events or triggers.

- Priority-Based Scheduling: Tasks are prioritized, and the scheduler picks the highest priority tasks available.

- Dependency Scheduling: Tasks are scheduled based on the completion or state of one or more preceding tasks.

**Stream processors**

Stream processors continuously handle and analyze data in real-time (or near-real-time) as it arrives.

Typical operations: transformation, aggregation, filtering, enrichment.

Given the continuous nature of streams, data is often divided into "**windows**" for analysis. This can be based on time 
(like every 10 seconds) or event count (like every 1,000 events).

**Backpressure**

In the realm of data processing and streaming, backpressure is a mechanism where receiving components 
can **signal** to their **producers** about their current availability, ensuring data isn't sent faster than what the 
receiver can process. It's crucial in maintaining system stability and preventing resource exhaustion.

## Data Processing & Transformation

We start by deciding how to handle the data. Sometimes we look at it in big chunks all at once, which we call 
**batch processing**. Other times, we examine it immediately as it comes in, known as **stream processing**.

To manage this incoming data, especially when there's a lot, we use a **temporary storage** or "waiting line" where data 
can briefly pause. This mechanism helps, especially when too much data comes rushing in too fast, letting the system 
ask for a pause or slow-down.

Some tasks require us to remember previous pieces of data, which is called maintaining state. Depending on the 
situation, our system might use past data (**stateful**) or treat each piece of data as brand new (**stateless**). 
For stateful processing, it's essential to define the state, 

As we work through the data, we often need to adjust or change it to be more useful, a process called **transformation**.
Sometimes, this means adding more details to our data, like if we know someone's city, we might add its population ‚Äì 
this is termed **enrichment**. It's also essential to ensure all our data looks and feels consistent, so we standardize 
or **normalize** it.

As we're working, it's a good habit to periodically save our progress. That way, if something goes out of control, we don‚Äôt 
have to redo everything. This saving is called **checkpointing**.

And, to ensure smooth operations, we design the system so that even if we accidentally repeat an action, it doesn't 
cause issues. That's called **idempotence**.

Lastly, when our system takes action, we make sure it‚Äôs either fully completed or, if there's a hiccup, fully 
reversed, ensuring the data's integrity. That's called **atomicity**.

**Stateful processing**

Stateful processing involves a system's ability to retain historical data for context. It starts by determining what 
information to remember and where to store it, be it in quick-access in-memory storage like RAM or more durable 
solutions like databases. Proper state management requires initializing, updating, and occasionally discarding 
outdated information. With potential concurrent access, strategies like locks ensure data consistency. As systems 
scale, state might spread across multiple machines, making distributed databases or caches useful. For resilience, 
the system can save periodic "checkpoints" or maintain data replicas. Performance can be boosted with techniques 
like caching, while security remains paramount. Regular monitoring ensures the system's reliability.

**Idempotence**
We achieve idempotence by carefully designing our API endpoints and utilizing unique identifiers, ensuring that 
repeated actions have consistent and predictable outcomes.

**Atomicity**

- Transactions: Most databases support transactions, where a series of operations are grouped and executed as one unit. If any operation in the transaction fails, the whole transaction is rolled back to its initial state.

- Two-Phase Commit: For distributed systems, where multiple databases or services are involved, a two-phase commit ensures atomicity across them all. First, all participants "vote" on whether they can commit. If all vote yes, a commit happens; otherwise, it's rolled back.

- Compensating Transactions: In long-running processes, immediate rollback might not be feasible. Instead, if something goes wrong, a compensating transaction is executed to counteract the earlier operations and bring the system back to a consistent state.

- Locks and Concurrency Control: To prevent multiple operations from interfering with each other, especially in multi-user systems, use locks or other concurrency control mechanisms.

## Data Storage

When it comes to storing our data, we first need to understand its nature and our access patterns. For structured 
data, like tables with defined fields, we use **relational** databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. If our data is more 
flexible or hierarchical, **NoSQL** databases like MongoDB or Cassandra might be more suitable.

The volume of our data also guides our choices. If we're looking at massive datasets that require distributed 
storage and fast processing, **big data solutions** like Hadoop's HDFS or Google's Bigtable come into play. For 
temporary or cache data that needs quick retrieval, **in-memory databases** like Redis or Memcached are ideal.

When we talk about the longevity of our data, **backups** become essential. Regularly backing up our data ensures that, 
in the event of failures or corruption, we don't lose crucial information. These backups can be incremental, where 
only changes are saved, or full, where the entire dataset is copied.

Data safety is paramount. Hence, we ensure **encryption**, both at rest and in transit. Encryption scrambles our data, 
making it unreadable without the right decryption keys, safeguarding it from unauthorized access.

As our data grows or our user base becomes more geographically diverse, we might use **sharding** or **replication**. 
Sharding divides our database into smaller, more manageable pieces, while replication creates copies of our data to 
improve access speed and reliability.

**Backups**

Backups are our safety net against data loss. By regularly copying and storing our data, either on-site, off-site, 
or on cloud platforms, we ensure that we can always recover essential information. Depending on our needs, these 
backups can be full, where all data is copied, or incremental, capturing only the changes since the last backup. The 
frequency, method, and storage of these backups are tailored based on the criticality of the data and our recovery 
objectives.

**Sharding and Replication**

To handle large volumes of data or to ensure quick access regardless of geography, we use strategies like sharding 
and replication. Sharding divides our data into chunks, distributing them across multiple servers, ensuring our 
system remains responsive and scalable. Replication, on the other hand, involves creating copies of our data. These 
replicas can serve read requests, balancing the load, and also act as a fail-safe in case the primary data source 
encounters issues.

## Case Study: Data ingestion pipeline with Operation Management - Netflix

**Data Generation**

The Media Algorithm teams at Netflix run algorithms on media files, like movies or shows. These 
algorithms analyze the content and generate data, such as identifying objects in a video.

**Data Storage**

This generated data, referred to as annotations, is ingested into the **Marken** system. Marken stores 
these annotations in a structured manner using Cassandra, a database system.

**Data Updates**

As algorithms improve or change, they might generate new or different data for the same media files. 
This means that the system needs to ingest updated data and manage it in a way that doesn't conflict with previous 
data. Instead of updating annotations directly, it manages different sets (or versions) of annotations separately. 
The approach of not directly updating annotations from previous runs ensures efficiency, maintains historical data, 
and accommodates the unpredictability of algorithm outputs.

**Data Retrieval**

ElasticSearch, another system used alongside Cassandra, helps in quickly searching and retrieving 
the ingested data. This is crucial for providing real-time recommendations to Netflix users.

### Marken Architecture

Marken's architecture is designed to ensure that the teams or systems producing annotations operate independently of 
the teams or systems using those annotations.

**How Marken separates them:**

- Different Data Paths: Producers put data into Marken, and consumers take data out. They use separate tools (APIs) 
for these tasks, so they don't interfere with each other.

- Version Handling: Producers can add new data versions without messing up old ones. Consumers always see the latest version without worrying about ongoing updates.

- By using ElasticSearch for searches, consumers don't directly query the primary storage (Cassandra).
  This separation ensures that frequent searches by consumers don't impact the performance or workload of the 
  primary database.

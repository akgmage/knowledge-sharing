# Autosharding

Autosharding primarily refers to the automatic partitioning of data across multiple servers or databases, as part of 
a strategy to improve scalability, performance, and availability in distributed systems. It's mostly discussed in 
the context of data management within databases or data storage systems.

However, the principles behind autosharding can also influence service sharding, albeit indirectly and under a 
broader category known as "automatic scaling" or "auto-scaling" in service architectures.

## Slicer: Auto-Sharding for Datacenter Applications

Slicer emerges as a highly sophisticated, **general-purpose** sharding service developed by Google. It's designed to 
**dynamically** partition workloads across servers in datacenter applications to optimize performance, **scalability**, 
and **availability**.

### Core Principles

- General Purpose Sharding Service: Slicer is not limited to specific types of applications or data. It can be applied 
universally, much like a filesystem or lock manager, providing a broad utility across Google's diverse ecosystem.

- Dynamic Work Distribution: It constantly monitors load and server health to adaptively distribute workloads. This 
dynamism ensures that Slicer can respond to changing conditions, such as load spikes or server failures, in real-time.

- High Availability and Load Balancing: One of Slicer's primary goals is to maintain high availability and evenly 
  distribute load across tasks, reducing resource wastage and improving system responsiveness.

### How It Works

<img width="871" alt="image" src="https://gist.github.com/assets/47337188/42b2fae7-e098-447e-93fa-6732287fb6bc">

Slicer has the following components:

- Slicer Service: The central component that generates and manages shard assignments.
- Clerk: A client library that interacts with the Slicer Service to obtain shard-to-task mappings.
- Slicelet: A server library that informs server tasks about their shard assignments.

A **shard/slice** is a portion of a dataset or workload.

A **(server) task** is an instance of a service running on a server that is designated to perform a specific set of 
operations or tasks. Each server task is responsible for handling a specific shard or set of shards.

The Slicer Service generates an assignment mapping key ranges (“slices”) to tasks and distributes it to the Clerks
and Slicelets, together called the subscribers. The Clerk **directs** client requests for a key to the assigned task. The
Slicelet **enables a task to learn** when it is assigned or relieved of a slice. The Slicer Service **monitors** load and
task availability to generate new assignments to maintain availability of all keys.

Application code interacts only indirectly with the Slicer Service via the Clerk and Slicelet libraries.

#### Why these 3 components

The division into these three components allows Slicer to separate concerns effectively.

- The Slicer Service acts as the central authority for shard assignment decisions. This centralized approach allows 
for a **global view** of the system's state, enabling intelligent decisions about workload distribution across server 
tasks.

- Clerks are necessary to **abstract the complexity** of shard management away from the client applications. By 
integrating with the client side, Clerks allow applications to interact with the sharded system without needing 
detailed knowledge of the underlying shard assignments.

- Slicelets are essential for managing the **dynamic** nature of shard assignments on the server side. Without them, 
server tasks would not be able to adapt to changes in shard assignments, leading to potential imbalances or 
inefficiencies.

#### Slicer Service - Fault Tolerance

The **Assigner** is a core component of the Slicer Service, acting as the central authority responsible for generating 
shard assignments.

**Distributors** serve as the intermediary layer that conveys the shard assignments from the Assigner to the Clerks and 
Slicelets within the system.
